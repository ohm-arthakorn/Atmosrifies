**Atmosrifies**
This is my first project at KMITL or King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.
I got a inspired from MV of Greasy Cafe. That MV is "หาย" by this MV is talking about a problem with air pollution.
That cause of lost in family so I watch and listen this MV that I've felt the same as I have to solve the problem to decrease this problem in the future.
So I created this project !
